# linear-regression-flight-prices
An ML to perform Linear Regression on a Flight Prices dataset using Python libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Scikit-learn

Estimating flight prices is a useful process that can help customers get an idea about what factors affect prices of the flights they travel on and tailor their future booking accordingly. However, airlines dynamically price their tickets based on several complex influences. There is no fixed method to it.


The dataset used here is a subset of the Flight Prices dataset containing around 4 million rows, which contains information about one-way flights found on Expedia, an online travel agency, between 2022-04-16 and 2022-10-05.

To achieve our goal, we first take a preliminary look at our data, and choose relevant attributes. Then, we perform some Feature Engineering to convert our data into a useable form that can be further used for EDA and Modelling. Null values are replaced, and duplicate rows are dropped. Next, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to gain a better understanding of our data. Finally, we perform several versions of Linear Regression to reduce prediction error and attempt to develop an accurate model.
